                        My name is Cara Crotty. I was born and raised in the Philippines. Outdoor activities including
                        hiking and nature photography are some of things I enjoy. I also enjoy traveling with my
                        husband. In my spare time, I like learning to program, cooking, baking and taking care of my
                        plants.

                        I attended public schools and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from
                        Polytechnic University of the Philippines. After college, I worked in various call center
                        providing technical support for a few years. Then, I had a role as a programmer developing
                        backend systems for a startup focused on products for the travel industry.
